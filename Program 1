Take two variables and store age then using if/else condition to determine
oldest and youngest among them.
void main() {
  int age1 = 25;
  int age2 = 30;
  if (age1 &gt; age2) {
    print(&quot;The oldest person is $age1 years old.&quot;);
    print(&quot;The youngest person is $age2 years old.&quot;);
  } else if (age2 &gt; age1) {
    print(&quot;The oldest person is $age2 years old.&quot;);
    print(&quot;The youngest person is $age1 years old.&quot;);
}
}
